                <p> Conventional wisdom tells us that there are certain indicators that determine whether a student will thrive or struggle in high school. This is an attempt to show the impact of socio-economic status on student success, using the outcome indicators of final GPA (weighted) and whether the student attended post-secondary classes the fall after their expected graduation date.</p>

            To what extent does Socio-Economic Status impact outcomes?
          </h1>
          <h3>The Data</h3>
          <p>All data comes from the 2009 High School Longitudinal Study. The socio-economic status variable was present in the first collection of data (from Fall 2009). Socioeconomic status is a factor of parents educational level and income.</p>
          <p>In all of these variables, nonresponse bias could be a huge issue. Non-response rates are over 20% for socio-economic status and post-secondary attendance, and about 7% for GPA. Self-reported numbers for socio-economic status could also be an issue. </p>
          <h3>Impact on GPA</h3>
          <p>The most startling difference between socio-economic groups evident in the following visualization is the GPA mode - for the lowest group, the mode is a measly 2.0, whereas for the highest group the mode is 3.5, and the second most frequent GPA is 4.0. Tabbing through each group will show a steady shift upward in GPA between each socio-economic group. </p>
          <p> Another interesting note is that through 20,000+ study participants, not a single student in the bottom 80% socio-economically had the highest attainable weighted GPA of 4.75. </p>

          <h3>Impact on Post-Secondary Attendance</h3>
          <p>
            The second indicator of success looks at whether a student ended up taking post-secondary classes the fall after their expected graduation date. The survey question associated with this data is whether the participant is "Taking classes from a college, university, community college, trade school, or other occupational school (such as a cosmetology school or a school of culinary arts)"
          </p>
          <p>
            Most immediately notable here is the 93.4% rate of attendance for the highest quintile. Post-secondary education appears to be the default option for this group.
